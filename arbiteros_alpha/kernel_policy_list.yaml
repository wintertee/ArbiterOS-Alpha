# Kernel Policy List
# This file contains policies defined by the kernel itself.
# These policies are read-only and cannot be modified by developers.
# They provide core governance rules that ensure system safety and reliability.

# Policy checkers validate execution constraints before instruction execution
policy_checkers:
  # Example: Prevent skipping verification steps
  # - type: HistoryPolicyChecker
  #   name: no_skip_verification
  #   bad_sequence: [GENERATE, TOOL_CALL]

# Policy routers dynamically route execution flow based on conditions
policy_routers:
  # Example: Route to retry when confidence is low
  # - type: MetricThresholdPolicyRouter
  #   name: retry_on_low_confidence
  #   key: confidence
  #   threshold: 0.5
  #   target: regenerate

# Graph structure checkers validate graph structure before execution
graph_structure_checkers:
  # Example: Ensure proper flow structure
  # - type: GraphStructurePolicyChecker
  #   blacklists:
  #     - name: no_direct_execute_without_reason
  #       sequence: [TOOL_CALL, TOOL_CALL]
  #       level: error
